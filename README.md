# IntentAppOne
This app (Intent App One) goes along with another app (Intent App Two).  "Intent App One" here has an explicit intent (taking you to "Activity 2" in the same app), and an implicit intent (taking you to "Intent App Two" if it is on the same device).  Thus, these two apps show off how you can go from one separate app to another, and illustrates the difference between an explicit intent and an implicit intent.
